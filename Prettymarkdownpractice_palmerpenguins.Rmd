# Learning how to create visualizations with Penguin Plots in Coursera    

*This is a collection of notes I've taken while learning about creating visualizations in R programming language *  

### Setting up my R environment by running the 'tidyverse' and 'palmerpenguins' packages.  

```{r Setting up , warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) ##the packages are part of the tidyverse so load that
install.packages("palmerpenguins") ## call the palmer penguin dataset
library(palmerpenguins) #load the library
```
  
### Learning about 'ggplot()' 
I learned:  
* 'aes' refers to the aesthetics of the plot  
* 'geom' refers to the geometry such as scatterplot, bars, lines etc  
*  how to add layers to visualizations by adding the '+' at the end of each layer  
  
*this was pretty fun*
```{r First ggplot, warning=FALSE}


## ggplot() is the function, the first argument is the dataset
## Then a + symbol adds a new layer to the plot
## geo_point is a geometry reference, the functions uses points to create scatterplots
##mapping=aes  aes is aesthetics the mapping() function is always paired with the aes() function
ggplot(data = penguins) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g))

```  
 
### Learning about Facets
This lets us see different aspects of the data in different charts  

```{r learning facets, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data=penguins)+
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=flipper_length_mm, y=body_mass_g, color=species))+
  facet_grid(~sex)
```
  

### Creating the final Penguin Plot visualization  
This adds color, labels, titles, subtitles, and annotations  

```{r Final Penguin visualization, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data=penguins)+
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=flipper_length_mm, y=body_mass_g, color=species))+
  labs(title="Palmer Penguins: Body mass vs. Flipper Length", subtitle="Sample of Three Penguin Species", caption= "Data Collected by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER")+
annotate("text", x=220, y=3500, label="The Gentoos are the largest",color="purple", fontface="bold",size=4.5,angle=45)

```
  
My mind was BLOWN when I found out that I was beginning to understand this!
